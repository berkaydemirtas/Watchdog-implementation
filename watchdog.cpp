/*! \mainpage Cmpe322 watchdog project
 * I am Berkay and 21 years old. I study Computer Engineering in Bogazici University.
 *
 * This projects enables us to create simple processes that are
 * watched by watchdog. I used pipes and signal handling in this project for the first time. So it was
 * very improving for me. I think one of the most challenging tasks in that projects is using sleep(). Because
 * of the scheduling mechanism of the computers, outputs can change time to time. Another challenging task was debugging.
 * During debugging, I learned many unix command. (kill, ps , ps aux etc.). At the end of the project, I have better understanding
 * about computer scheduling, using pipes and signal handling.

/**
 * @file watchdog.cpp
 * * Compile: g++ watchdog.cpp -o watchdog
* ./watchdog processNum processOut WatchdogOut
 * @brief this files contains the code for watchdog. Watchdog creates expected number of processes and check if
 * any of the processes die. If any of them is dead, then create them according to rules. This program takes some
 * argumants from command line.
 * @param  numberOfProcesses  holds the path of the process watchdog file
 * @param processOutput holds the path of the process output file
   @param watchdogOutput holds the path of the watchdog output file

    This was a very improving project for me. I used pipe and signal handling for the first time.
    Detailed description follows here.
